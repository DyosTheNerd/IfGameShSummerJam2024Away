Class to track PlayerData over several scenes.
This way we can package all player relevant data into a single object to take with.
For example.
    Which controller belongs to which player.
    How many points the player got this round
    Which ship did this player choose

or whatever. maybe its too generic, but we can worry about that when it becomes a problem.
