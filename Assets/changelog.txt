### Version 0.1.2 AA 2024-07-18
- further refactoring.
    - CameraController
      -- made camera less dependant on manual configuration
      -- setting Radius and LookAt should reposition camera accordingly (but i would like opinions on the implementation)
      -- changed camera to an Orthographic projection.
      -- camera now has initialValues that can be set in the inspector.
    - Deleted the dummyPlayer.cs script (it was just to test the camera.)
    - Deleted the PickUpMovement.cs script. (it was 90% the player movement script with less stuff)
        --this included removing some references to it from several other scripts.
    - ShipToolManager
      -- made private all the private sub-vector calculations.
      -- now uses Asteroid.Instance.Center to compute some of the sub vectors.


- trying to fix some of the nausea issues
  - removed stars from background
  - added a polar axis to still give a sense of where up is. I can prettify later
  -- some of the camera changes were due to this also.
